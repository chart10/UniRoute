1.3 Intended Use

3.3 System Requirements\*

These describe required conditions for your software to be able to run. These would typically be CPU/RAM requirements, like you see for some video games. For a web app, you may not have anything to say in this section, and that's fine - just call out if there are any special requirements or heavy loads your server may have to deal with.
