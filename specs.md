1.4 Scope
   - UniRoute is intended for college students attending big city Universities to get to and from class in a quick and efficient fashion without having to deal with the uncertainty of public transport. Users will be able to put in a destination and find the quickest route utilizing both city public transport (i.e bus, train, etc) and school transport systems. To make the process more streamlined and unique, one may input their weekly class schedule and destinations to have a route set up for you every day of the week and give precise times to leave based on traffic and other possible delays.
